        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          A designer by trade, Jared’s a seasoned vet whose misguided youth of skateboarding and hair metal inspired him to pursue a creative career. With over a decade in the design game, Jared’s worn out Wacoms for blue chip brands like Coke, Microsoft, Nike, MTV, Rossignol, and K2. While Jared loves getting busy on the big stage, his true passion lies in conjuring brands out of thin air—amassing a formidable collection of design awards for the identities he’s built.

      If you've ever been nipples deep in fresh<br>
      Utah pow you get why we're here.

    <p>
      We could’ve set up shop anywhere. We ended up in the shadows of the SLC mountains because it’s a<br> kickass place to live and, frankly, we all have a powder problem. We like being off the beaten agency<br> path and are hell bent on proving you can do world-class work from anywhere, especially if you love<br> where you lay your head. We’ve done our damndest to build a one of a kind shop and stack it to the<br> rafters with handpicked, hyper-talented malcontents from across the country who share our passion<br> for hard work and hard play.

    <h1>STS MANIFESTO</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      We got stuff you don't even know about. We're an enigma, wrapped in a riddle, deep-fried in a vat of mind-boggler. We're so lean you can see those weird muscles you never knew existed. Our favorite clouds are greenish black Cumulonimbus. If we could get a hold of some cobra blood we would drink it. We wish we were born to Viking parents in the days of yore. We fall somewhere between war lords and Lords of Dance. We eat beef jerky sandwiches. Our drug of choice is caffeine. We all have done things for money we're ashamed of. We're fearless. We talk about burritos in reverent, hushed tones. We believe Gandhi should've picked up a stick and kicked some British ass. We like caterpillars that keep it real and don't turn into butterflies. Our favorite holiday is Columbus Day. Our standards are so high we're not impressed by the Grand Canyon or NASA. We believe global warming is better than cold war. We loathe copious amounts of stitching on pant pockets. We always root for the Washington Generals. We don't believe in half ass, mediocrity or failure. We know sarcasm is the lowest form of humor but we still think it's funny. We would win both showcases on the Showcase Showdown. We don't believe ice dancing should be considered a sport, let alone an Olympic one. We would pay good money to see a bear fight a shark. We don't believe in straws, umbrellas or scarves. We won't watch a movie that doesn't have at least one explosion. 75% of us drive German automobiles, 25% of us don't. We have a gumball machine full of adderall and Excedrin Migraine. We're still bitter about having to learn the Dewey Decimal system. We think the worst and coolest form of advertising is a giant purple gorilla. We are Super Top Secret.
